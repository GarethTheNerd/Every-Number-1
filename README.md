# Every-Number-1

Personal repo: a small script that adds every number since I was born to a Spotify playlist.

Others are free to use, copy, or modify the code if they find it useful. Credit is appreciated but not required.

Notes
- You’ll likely need Spotify developer credentials and a target playlist to run it.
- See `script.py` for the current entry point and logic.
